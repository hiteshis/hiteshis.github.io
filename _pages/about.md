Hi, I am a PhD student in Stochastic Systems and Learning Laboratory (S2L2), under Prof. [Rahul Jain](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~rahuljai/Welcome.html). I am interested in reinforcement learning, online learning, stochastic control and high-dimensional statistics. During my PhD, I have been working primarily on approximate dynamic programming for reinforcement learning.  My focus was to design interpretable (not black-box) learning algorithms. I designed dynamic programming based algorithms in conjunction with random feature kernel methods.  I tested these algorithms on [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) simulator, locomotion tasks in [MuJoCo](http://mujoco.org/) and  quadrupedal bot movement in [PyBullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/tree/master/examples/pybullet/gym/pybullet_envs/minitaur/envs). We also analyzed these algorithms to provide performance guarantees in probability. Before coming to USC, I had a great time at IIT Bombay. 

```I am on job market, actively seeking full time positions in machine learning starting summer 2020. ```

**Interesting Tidbit**: Many people think that my name is Japanese like a combination of Hitachi and Mitsubhishi but it is actually a sanskrit word which means well-wisher.
