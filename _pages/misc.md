I have been interested in performing arts, particularly dramatics. During my stay at USC, I have been actively involved in 
all-Indian improv comedy troupe, [Vidushak](https://www.facebook.com/usc.vidushak). Previously at IIT Bombay, I was a part of 
dramatics club, [Fourthwall] (https://www.facebook.com/IITBombay.fourthwall/).
